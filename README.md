**Idle Boost** was created by [moritz_htk](https://github.com/moritz-htk) with inspiration from [Idle Tweaks](https://github.com/Armandukx/IdleFPS) by [Armandukx](https://github.com/Armandukx). This mod reduces FPS, render distance and volume when Minecraft is running in the background.

There are some advantages this mod has over other similar mods:
- Easy to configure due to the use of [Cloth Config API](https://github.com/shedaniel/cloth-config)
- Works on Fabric and NeoForge due to the use of [Architectury API](https://github.com/architectury/architectury-api)
- Small and lightweight, with a file size of 22KB/23KB
- Open Source
